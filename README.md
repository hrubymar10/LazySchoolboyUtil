# LazySchoolboyUtil
File Generator for students that are either lazy or don't have time at all.

# What is it good for?
Well, I guess that every student knows the situation when they must submit their homework or a project but they haven't even started working or just don't have much time left. And this is the "solution". Well, not really a solution (to be exact) but something that can give you some more time to finish you project.

# How does it work?
LazySchoolboyUtil is a framework that allows you to generate a fake file which you will submit instead of your 'real' project. The point is that this fake file will look for example as normal .zip but can't be opened. So later on, when the teacher decides that he will go and check your project, he won't be able to open it. At the best case he will ask you about submitting it again because the old project was broken. But now you will submit completed working project. Easy.

# Requirements
